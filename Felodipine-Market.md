Furthermore, the increasing awareness regarding cardiovascular health and the importance of blood pressure management is expected to contribute positively to market growth.</p> <p>According to recent market forecasts, the Felodipine market size was valued at approximately USD 724 million in 2024. This value is projected to grow, reaching around USD 951 million by 2032, demonstrating a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of roughly 4.2% during the forecast period.
